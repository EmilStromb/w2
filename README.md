This project is not finnished!

Its a webapplication so to start it you need to start up a localhost

This project is the latest working so you can start up the localhost without buggs!

I know I haven't come far but you can still think about my layout of MVC, my diagrams and see my code to see if something there is wrong, should be moved etc.
